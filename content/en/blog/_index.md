Here you will find some of my adventures as a PhD student, ranging from field work to conferences to daily lab work and writing. This will not be updated on regular times because I do not have a regular schedule, like many PhD students will be able to tell you. I do hope this will give you a glimpse of the different aspects of scientific life. And mainly, I do this because I like writing, especially in an informal, intriguing way.
